## How to use

To run locally, navigate to the root of the project, then:

# Install

```bash
yarn install:all
```

# Run

```bash
yarn start
```

# Run production

```bash
yarn build:run
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000

.env on the client side has been left in the project which I would otherwise not do
